# Movie Rating Prediction Using Python

## Task 2: 
Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

## Overview
Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that can estimate the ratings of movies accurately.

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies
- **Files:**
  - `IMDb Movies India.csv`: Train and test set with labels (rating- target variable).

## Files in this Repository
- `Movies_Rating_Prediction_CodSoft.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the analysis.
- `IMDb Movies India.csv`: Train/ Test Dataset.

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Engineered new features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the distribution of key variables (age, gender, class).
   - Investigated survival rates across different categories.

3. **Statistical Insights:**
   - Calculated summary statistics for key variables.
   - Conducted hypothesis tests if applicable.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations to convey key insights.
   - Used matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

5. **Feature Engineering and Data Modelling:**
   - Used Linear Regression, xgboost, Gradient Boost, Lght Gradient Boost Machine, CatBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
   - Out of all, the Random Forest gave us best accuracy with 95%.

## Running the Analysis
1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `Movies_Rating_Prediction_CodSoft.ipynb`
